# HandWritten-Digit-Recognition-Using-MNIST-dataset
The Handwritten Digit Recognition project is a machine learning-based application developed in Python that can accurately identify and classify handwritten digits. This project utilizes the popular MNIST dataset, consisting of thousands of hand-drawn digits, to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

Key Features:

Trained a robust CNN model for accurate digit recognition.
Preprocessed the dataset, including data normalization and one-hot encoding.
Designed the CNN architecture with convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction and downsampling.
Implemented dropout layers to prevent overfitting during training.
Utilized the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function for efficient model training.
Incorporated early stopping and model checkpointing for improved training performance.
Achieved a high accuracy rate of 98.8% on the test dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
This project serves as a demonstration of proficiency in deep learning, computer vision, and model evaluation. It showcases the capability to build and train a machine learning model for practical image recognition tasks.
