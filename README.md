**Handwritten Digit Recognition** 📊 🖋️

The Handwritten Digit Recognition project is a machine learning-based application developed in Python that can accurately identify and classify handwritten digits. This project utilizes the popular MNIST dataset, consisting of thousands of hand-drawn digits, to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

**Key Features:** ✨

- Trained a robust CNN model for accurate digit recognition. 🧠
- Preprocessed the dataset, including data normalization and one-hot encoding. 📈
- Designed the CNN architecture with convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction and downsampling. 📷
- Implemented dropout layers to prevent overfitting during training. 🚫
- Utilized the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function for efficient model training. ⚙️
- Incorporated early stopping and model checkpointing for improved training performance. 🏁
- Achieved a high accuracy rate of **98.8%** on the test dataset for handwritten digit recognition. 👏

This project serves as a demonstration of proficiency in deep learning, computer vision, and model evaluation. It showcases the capability to build and train a machine learning model for practical image recognition tasks. 🌟
